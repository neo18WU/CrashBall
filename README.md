This project begin with the implementation of a GLSL Shader on a THREE.js basic scene.

To work well, you have to upload npm packages:
  - THREE.js
  - Vite

The master branch create the environnement and the first object with a THREE.ShaderMaterial.
The shader was created with an implementation of a vertexShader and a fragmentShader

The first branch show you how to use the shader on a MeshStandardMaterial with a pre-compilation of the shader by replacing the original one with your own shader.

See you soon for the next step...
